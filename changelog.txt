## Composer Update
- Updated to use minimum of php 7 (I rolled back from 8.1. as a lot of depretiation notices) 
- crysalead/kahlan removed and replaced with kahlan/kahlan


## Update NextDay Function
Trying to implement a more DRY approach to the item structure. Therefore, I have created an ItemAbstract.php where each item can utilise the necessary functions to increase / decrease the quality of items. 

## Abstract Class Creation
 - Allows each item to derive calculations set by the class

## Individual Item Class Creation
- Default Item Class created for Normal products and used to extend to conjured item. 
- NextDay function for this class placed within each individual items.


## Gilded Rose Spec
-  Changed the Testing parameters to the instance class of each item. This allows a single point of change in the Item Class (for example if name changes)
- Updated Parameters to getQuality and getSellIn from the Abstract Class extension to each Item
